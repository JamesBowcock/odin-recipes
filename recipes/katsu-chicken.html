    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>1 cup panko breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>Vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>Katsu sauce (store-bought or homemade)</li>
        <li>Cooked white rice, for serving</li>
        <li>Shredded cabbage, for serving (optional)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Place the chicken breasts between two sheets of plastic wrap and pound them to an even thickness, about 1/2 inch thick. Season both sides with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Set up a breading station with three shallow dishes: one with flour, one with beaten eggs, and one with panko breadcrumbs.</li>
        <li>Dredge each chicken breast in the flour, shaking off any excess. Dip into the beaten eggs, then coat with panko breadcrumbs, pressing gently to adhere.</li>
        <li>In a large skillet, heat about 1/2 inch of vegetable oil over medium-high heat until shimmering.</li>
        <li>Carefully place the breaded chicken breasts in the hot oil. Fry for about 4-5 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through (internal temperature should reach 165°F or 74°C).</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken from the oil and drain on paper towels.</li>
        <li>Slice the chicken into strips and serve over cooked white rice. Drizzle with katsu sauce and serve with shredded cabbage if desired. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
